# What is Deen?

**Deen** is a **statically-typed**, **compiled** programming language designed for **simple and performant development**.
Deen provides you **with** tools for building structured and efficient software with **a** focus on speed and manual control **over every piece of your code**.

The main syntax and ideas **are taken** from such languages as Rust, Zig, and C.

## How it works?

The **compiler** breaks the main process into separated stages of compilation: lexer, parser, semantic analyzer, and code generator.
As **its** backend, Deen uses LLVM, which provides maximum performance of the compiled binary (comparable with C).
