# Strings
**Strings** in the Deen compiler are similar to those in the C programming language. <br/>
The core mechanics are as follows: every symbol is a `char`, and a string is simply a pointer to a `char` array. <br/>

To define a string constant, just use double quotes:
```deen
"Something here"
"Hello World!"
"Do you reading this?"
```
